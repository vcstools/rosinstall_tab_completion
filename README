This package only provides bash completion scripts for scripts in the
rosinstall package.
The scripts here were moved outside of roinstall due to several reasons:

* They are only valid on Linux + bash systems
* The install location is an absolute path (/etc/bash-completion.d) which is only valid on some systems
* The easy install tool fails with SandboxViolation even for targeted Linux systems, whereas pip installs fine
